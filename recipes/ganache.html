    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Chocolate ganache is a silky smooth mixture of chocolate cream, perfect for fillin, frosting and glazing cakes</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Semisweet chocolate</li>
        <li>Heavy cream</li>
        <li>Rum(optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients </li>
        <li>Place chocolate in a medium mixing bowl</li>
        <li>Heat cream in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring just to a boil, watching very carefully because if it boils for even a few seconds, it will boil out of the pot.</li>
        <li>As soon as the cream comes to a boil, pour it over the chocolate in the mixing bowl. Whisk until chocolate has melted and mixture is smooth, then stir in rum.</li>
        <li>To use ganache as a cake glaze, cool slightly, 5 to 10 minutes. Start pouring glaze at the center of the cake and work outward.</li>
        <li>For a fluffy frosting or chocolate filling, allow it to cool until thick (up to 1 hour in the refrigerator), and then whip until light and fluffy. Apply it with a spatula like a conventional frosting.</li>
    </ol>
